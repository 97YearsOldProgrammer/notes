## Lecture1 ##

we look into the hydrostatic system and go over differnt principle that applies to them

- passal principle
  - hydrostatic benoulli euqation
  - gravitational potential energy density
  
experiment1 : display of hydrostatic system
- that have different shapes and volume of container
- we give same amount of water in there, we see what would be the overall static system be, as different water level

experiment2 : display of passal's principle
- i don't see it clearly, btw he go over principle of passal's principle
- how the air pressure play around with different system

### hydrostatic system ###

- hydrostatic system
  - *where the fluids meet they have the same pressure*    

**Passal's principle**

- whenever pressure applied to a static, confined fluid is distributed throughout the fluid and its container walls undiminished

- system 1
  - for a container, this would apply to its open top
  - Ptop = `Patm = 1atm = 101325Pa`
  - SI unit for Pascal: `1 Pascal = N/m^2 = 1/m^2 (N = kg * m/s^2)`
  - this explained how pressure existed on the static, confined fluid

- system 2: piston on system1
  - there is a piston(活塞) pressing down the fluid with force F
  - now the Papplied = F/A A = area
  - this explain how Pascal principle talks about undiminished pressure

- look back system 1
  - for two spot in the cylinder container ; p2 and p1 ; p1 is higher than p2
  - the lower spot would have higher pressure
  - p2 = p1 + pressure applied by fluid between there points
  - p2 = p1 + mg/ A(area of container)

```
p2 = p1 + mgh/Ah(Volume, V)
m/Ah = m/V = σ(mass density of fluid)
unit of [σ] = kg/m^3  
p2 = p1 + σhg
p2 = p1 + σg(y1 - y2) : height = y1 - y2
p2 - p1 + σg(y1 - y2) = 0
```
- **Hydrostatic Bernulli Equation**
  - `△p + σg △y = 0`
  - gravitational potential energy density = σgy 
  - we could now understand pressure is a sort of energy
  - [P] = pascal/Pa = N/m^2 = Nm/m^3 = J/m^3 = energy/volume

- now image another system, further application on question solving
  - in a open lid cylinder container
  - there is oil stay on top of the water
  - water is in the bottom
  - give initial condition
    -  P oil = 800 kg/m^3
    -  hw = 0.4m
    -  P bottom is 150kPa
  -  how we find the H oil?
  
- we apply the hydrostatic bernulli equation first
  - `△p + σg △y = 0`
  - solving process

```
Po : Po - P bottom + σg(y0 - ybottom)[height difference] = 0
P0 = P bottom - σ(w)ghw
P_atm - P_oil + σ_oil * g *(y_top - y_bottom)[height_difference] = 0
``` 

### what if the fluid is flowing ###

- system1
  - imagine a long pipe; there is water flowing in there
  - `Bernoulli Equation` explain this; previous one is hydrostatic bernoulli equation
  -  △p + σg △y + △KE/Vol [since this system is open] = 0 [no dissipation or sources]
  -  conduction below represent conservation of energy density at two locations in a flowing system

```
kinetic energy density = 1/2 p v^2
△p + σg △y + 1/2 * p * △v^2 = 0
△v^2 = v2^2 - v1^2 (keep in mind that this is not equal to (v2-v1)^2 )
```

- introduce concept of flow rate I 
   - this is amount of fluid volume passing through a point in the system per unit time
   - I = volume through cross-sectional area/time interval
   - [I] = m^3/s
   - `I = △V/△t` or it's `I = dV/dt`
   - now we specify the volume
   - `I = A(cross section) dx(x = length of cross section) /dt = A 
   - `I = Av`
- we'll assume fluids are incompressible --> fluid ; volume remains constant
- this is just easier assumption for our course

- `continuity equation`
  - current is constant throughout the system
  - if we compare two locaitons for different flow rate
  - imagine a wine bottle which I1 have larger volme I2 at nearly end of the wine bottle
  - conduction below --> `speed only change if the area of the pipe changes`

```
stated by continuity equation: I1 = I2
we would have   A1v1 = A2v2 , since I = Av
△p + σg △y + 1/2 * p * △v^2 = 0
g is only nonzero if △y != 0
```

Extended/Complete Bernoulli equations:
△p + σg △y + 1/2 * p * △v^2 = -I(disspation)R(existance of pipe[termal energy change]) + E_pump/V
△(Eth/V) = IR
R = resistance between whatever point you're considering
[R] = Js/m^6

TA information   
name:  antyom   
email: alistisyn@ucdavis.edu  
room: 2314    
OH: monday 5:00 - 6:30    

```
ΔE_tot / vol   = W   
ΔPE_grav/ vol  = p * g Δy
ΔKE/vol        = 1/2 p Δ(v^2)
ΔE_thermal/vol = I(water flow)R(resistance of pipe[something inside the pipe])
ΔP(pressure)   = he said this is considered lastly 
```

- energy density equation
  - ΔKE/vol + ΔPE_grav/vol + ΔP = E_pvmp/vol - ΔEth/vol

- continuity equation
  - I1 = I2
  - the water comes in == water comes out 
  - reminder: I = water flow
  - variable contribute to I
    - speed of water
    - container size

- scenario
  - when container size is larger, speed remain constant, the I become larger

- more about continuity equation
  - since I1 = I2
  - if one side of the pipe have larger Volume, it's gonna have smaller speed
  - for another side of the pipe that have smaller volume, it's gonna have large speed to maintain I1 = I2 

- change in resistance would not decrease the water velocity
  - since v = I/A
  - btw change in area would effect the velocity

- a way to think about pressure
  - ΔP means pascal
  - pressure is force
  - force = F/A = [J/m] / [m^3] = [ J/m^3 ]
  - F = W(word/d(distance)
  - force is sort of stored energy

- guage pressure
  - some pressure don't include the atomsphere pressure
  - something don't compare to atomsphere pressure
  - ppl use this for tire pressure (like 40psi)
  - this is the pressure difference
  - Pbottom - Ptop = pgΔy
  - this is ΔPressure

- absolute pressure
  - guage pressure + Patm

website with question for practice: https://alisitsyn.com/research/

- equation that explain why lower pipe would have higher pressure
  - $∆P + \frac{1}{2}∆(v^{2}) + \rho g∆h = 0$
  
- with given a system with different pressure and height 
  - we try to figure out what's the different between height of different pipe
  - given out new conditions 
  - $∆P1 + \rho g∆h1 = 0$
  - $∆P2 + \rho g∆h2 = 0$
  - we also have initial condition of h1 bottom and h2 bottom
  - btw we don't know how's the relatioship between h1 top and h2 top
    - h1 top = h1 bottom + ∆h1
    - h2 top = h2 bottom + ∆h2
  - using this to rewrie the original equation
    - $(P2 - P1) + \frac{1}{2}∆(v^{2}) + \rho g(h2 bottom - h1 bottom) = 0$
    - $(Patm - P1) + \rho g∆h1 = 0$
    - $(Patm - P2) + \rho g∆h2 = 0$
  - using rewrite quation to get P1 and P2
    - $P1 = Patm + \rho g∆h1$
    - $P2 = Patm + \rho g∆h2$
  - looks back original question
    - h2 top - h1 top = h2 bottom - h1 bottom + ∆h2 - ∆h1
  - look into ∆h2 - ∆h1 by rewrite previous equations
    - $∆h1 = \frac{P1 - Patm}{\rho g}$
    - $∆h2 = \frac{P2 - Patm}{\rho g}$
  - plug values backward
    - $∆h2 - ∆h1 = \frac{P2 bottom - P1 bottom}{\rho g}$
  - how we know which Pressure is larger ; we could look at this
    - $∆P + \frac{1}{2}∆(v^{2}) + \rho g∆h = 0$
    - $∆P = -\frac{1}{2}∆(v^{2}) - \rho g∆h$
    - $\frac{ - \frac{1}{2} \rho ∆( v^{2} ) - \rho g∆h }{\rho g}$
  - as h2 bottom - h1 bottom is negative, we could remove $- \rho g∆h$ here
    - $\frac{ - \frac{1}{2} \rho ∆( v^{2} )}{\rho g}$
  - and we know ∆v is become slower as area in bottom is larger
  - whole solution is negative 
  - there is another negative sign before
  - we got there
  
### how we calcualte units ###

1 atm = $2\times10^{5} Pa$ = $\frac{N}{m^{2}}$ = $\frac{kg \frac{m}{s^{s} } }{m^{2} }$ = $kg \frac{1}{s^{2}m  }$

### FNTs from Dl1 ###

- q2: try to understand difference between gaurage pressure and absolute pressure
  - kinda remember the atomsphere pressure
  - absolute pressure = relative pressure + 1atm 
 
- q3: try to remember that there is more pressure in the right handside ; that lower gravitational there ; higher pressure
  - also try to image there is more pressure, so this is pressing liquid downward 

- q4: compare different spots for pressure comparison
  - we shall determine whethere these spots are in the same system or not
  - answer: we figured that they are in the same system; and same height
  - they would share the same pressure as long as they are in the same system
  - we could verifiy this further with the `bernoulli equation`
    -  $∆P = P + \rho gh$
  - also remember the reason why we can apply `bernoulli equation` there bc this system is equal

- q5: we shall pick some nice relative standard
  - so that we can aplly bernoulli equation to them to compare their pressure
  - in this question,   P2 < P3 < P1 
  - since p2 have 
  - reason of pressure in air doesn't matter
    - since density of air is too slightly
    - for change in $\rho gh$

OH next Tuesday: 5:00pm - 6:30 pm  better come that time

- resistance per unit length
  - $IR = \frac{∆Eth}{vol}$
  - R: resistance
  - L: length pipe section
  - R* : resistance per unit length

- homemade experiment 
  - calculate the R* out
  - formula $∆P = -IR$
  - $\rho g∆y = - Av(R*)L$
  - $R* = \frac{\rho g∆y}{AvL}$
  - as long as we measure out the values; we plug in
  - for the unit, 

- **FNT2**
  
- Q2:
  - since they share the same initial pressure, the pressure would be the same overall
  - even double in lenght, rise the resistance up 
  - there would result in lower velocity throughout the time
  - not change in pressure    

- Q1:
  - the pressure is also the same overall system
  - system A and C have the same final change in height
  - thus, I would result highest in B
  - Ia = Ic < Ib

analogy for electrical system by 

| static water system                                           | electrical equivalent
|:-------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------
| pipe with resistance $Δ\frac{E}{V} = -IR$                     | conductor with resistance (resistor) $ΔV = Vhigh - Vlow = IR$ $[R] = \frac{V}{A} = Ohms(\omega)$
| pipe without resistance                                       | conductor without resistance $ΔV = 0$
| Pump （source of $\frac{E}{V}$) creator a pressure difference | Battery / Electromotive Force (EMF) ; source of voltage ; creator a voltage difference between its two terminals ; moves electron from low to high V

  
### Kirchhoff's laws ###

| rule name      | details
|:--------------:|:--------
| loop rule      | sum of voltage changes around a complete loop is zero $\sum_{complete loop}ΔV=0$
| junction rule  | more general version of continuity equation ; electric charge is conserved ; electric charge entering some location must leave that location $I total in = I total out$

### networks of resistors ###

| different resistor combination | details
|:------------------------------:|:-------
| resistors in series            | bunch of resistor in the same line ; R1--R2--.... ; given a Req to the whole resistor series ; easier way for simplified the circuits ; Ir1 = Ir2 = ...  ; ΔVreq = ΔVr1 + ΔVr2 + .... ; ΔV = IR ; Req = R1 + R2 + .... ; for resistor in series, total resistance increases
| resistors in parallel          | also think about making them as Req as a total ; Ireq = Ir1 + Ir2 + ... ; ΔVr1 = ΔVr2 = .. =ΔVreq ; ΔV/Req = ΔV/R1 + ΔV/R2 + .... ; $\frac{1}{Req}$ = $\frac{1}{R1}$ + $\frac{1}{R2}$ + .... ; resistors in parallel --> total resistance goes down

### electric circuit ###

- a simple electric circuit
  - an emf that creating high voltage region and low voltage region
  - current flow from high voltage to low voltage region
    - charge move that way for lower it's chemical potential
  - resistance somewhere in the circuit
  - the rest are neglectable resistance   

- loop rule on such simple circuit
  - normal circumstance : $ΔV = e$ 
  - if we pass a resistance area : $ΔV = -IR$
    - $e - IR=0$ 
    - $I = \frac{e}{R}$
