## lecture 1 ##

he goes over all details about overall course design

--------------------------------------------------------------

## lecture 2 ##

he talks about more detail for literature review
steps for making such good literature review

- pick readings that we are gonna include
  -  we could focus on abstract summary of reading
  -  he said we don't wanna read everything in there
   
- introduction
  - minilif review
  - evalute a synthesis peak IMRADS through praise and critcize
  - read IMRADS to build literature review 

- methods
  - receipe
  - methods, material, protocol

- results
  - everything they focus
  - their object 
  
- abstract?
  - summary
  - introduction
  - something etc

- discussion
  - inerprett ; self-evalute ther finding
    - either praise or criticism
    - future research examine

he said the IMRAD is more than summary of multiple paper, but more about it, make either praise or criticism

### literature review 1 ###

- there are many kinds of literature reviews
  - we are gonna focus on a particular kind of literature review
  - we are gonna write a traditional literature review

- there are even literature review contain 0 studies
  - don't pick other literature reivew to build our literature review 

- critical connection
  - science is a trajectory of research
  - be critical to certain literature review is not being critical merely on it
  - btw connect to another research 

- we are working on a smaller scope of the science
- we are not gonna writing a research paper on this assignment
  - since research paper is not critical
  - we are gonna evalute those studies and be critical thinking on them

- IMRADS also called the method paper

### literature review 2 ###

- we are gonna pick article within the last five years
  
- remember not all topics work 
  - if this topic is not able to find topics on it
  - we should use other topic out there
  
- find more paper than the required paper
  - if some IMRADs are longer than what our required; we shall also keep it

- look top right of the paper
  - make sure that this is not the literature review
  - if that is a review; don't pick it
  - avoid using scholarly articles that are not original research

- strategy
  - we could read the literature review, see whether there are appropriate IMRADs
  - finding articile that could be useful on this project


### prompt about this ###

- we are not writing for generalist, btw image on of our professor in major
  
- summary or hovering
  - don't do that; make more than this
  
- policy assetion or cost
  - this is not the place of taking what we shall doing
  - make clear for other specialist what we have already done
  - be stick to the science

- don't do would, could, should, might, must, can, needs
  - write based on current study
  - don't shame on them

- make fair criticism
  - imagine further meet the author
  - don't criticism based on purpose or etc    

--------------------------------------------------------------

## lecture 3 ##

he break down the lit review into three sections

- title
  - introduction
  - hook
    - obstacle to current research ; be clear as possible  
  - background
    - old study for context ; not included in 4 - 6 original paper 
    - background for specialists whoever not familiar with current topics
    - 1-2 sentences
  - roadmap 
    - talked about all the studies that how they tie together
    - goes 4-6 articles, not title, make author name at all, not everybody in the paper
    - how story are connected in a paragraph
    - solid paragraph
    - also name the theme there

- discussion
  - with different themes with same format 
  - one paragraph <-- mini-intro
    - list the articles of this theme
    - listng here is okay
    - another introduction out there
    - it should aligned up with the previous roadmap ; he said this is way to anticipate picky reader out there
  - two body paragraph between them
    - how two articles are conected
    - synthesizing at least two articiles
    - try to show how one article connect to another article
    - technique for lit review
    - topic sentence --> name 2 research teams + puts together
    - example: criticise one --> move to another one for make progress them
    - don't do summary 
    - different body paragraph could do overlap 
    -   
  - one paragraph <-- mini-outro 
    - connect to conclusion
    - accessing what we know from this theme
  - between different themes should be linkd
    - ideally they shall connected with each other
    - intro of paragraph theme2 should connect to mini-outro of previous theme   

- conclusion
  - conclusion for previous mini-outro paragraphs

### how to synthesize IMRADs ###

- read abstracts to pick articles
  - btw never cite those abstracts

- he suggested to chart different articles
  - so it's easier for ppl to understand everything
  - help for personal understanding

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## lecture 4 ##

- don't put time on telling the reader that is articles are similar 
  - similarity are the starting points
  - try to make argument instead of listing the similarity

- sometimes data publication works ; btw not necessary
  - think about some articles further than something

- **meaningful difference**
  - make synthesis cycle ; similarity --> differece --> evaluaiton

- btw he also said similarity is required for connecting two aritcile into same background
  - group paper together and then seperate each one
  - evaluation step: similarities > difference > evaluation

- he said evalution means one thing is better than another thing
  - consider what comes next ; the trajectory of science
  - make words as better
  - most evaluation comes out the IMRADs
  - also okay to criticise

- don't write more about the articles u like
  - btw also articles ain't that good
  - reverse engineer
