## lecture 1 ##

### course material ###

this course is basically bis102 + bis103

*for BIS102*

- amino acids
- oligopeptides
- proteins
- lipids
- membranes

*for BIS105*

- portions of metabolism
  - glycolysis
  - Krebs cycle
  - ETC
  - ATP synthase
  - photosynthesis

### course themes ###

- 1 importance of weak bonds
  - hydrogen bonds
  - ionic bond
  - Van der waals
  - hydrophobic effect

- ideas of entropy in biochemistry ( basically chemistry in biology )
  - Delta G = delta H - T * delta S
  - G : total energy to do work
  - H : enthalpy (heat)
  - T : temperature
  - cells as chemical engines

he said we just kinda remember the ideas of this equation; either from heat or temperature
recap: negative of gibbs energy means spontaneous


### animal cell example ###

he give us a animal cell picture
he mentioned think of this animal cell from a `dynamic` perspective

- components of cells
  - 70% H2O
  - 15% Proteins
  - 1% DNA 6% RNA as nucleic acids
  - 3% glucose, glycogen as carbohydrates
  - 2% lipid ; either for hormones or as fatty acids
  - 1% other small organic molecules as `NAD+` (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) 2e- carrier
     - example: `FMN` (flavin mononucleotide) 
     - `FMN` as 1e- carrier : chemically, this is **free-radical**
     - resonance structure of FMN make this become a free-radical
  - inorganic ions ; Zn+2, Mg+2, Fe3+, HPO4-2, Cl-, etc

- main atoms
  - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphur, sulfur

### biological conclusion ###

- everything is important in a cell
- biomolecules have evolved to function in an aqueous environment
  - he want to say that keep in mind that every biological stuff is surrounder by water
  - and life is dynamic

### Amino acid ###

aa is the building block of proteins

- peptide
  - N-terminus
  - a string of amino acids residue 
  - connect by the peptide bond
  - C-terminus

also remember everything is surrounded by water H2O
this gonna folded as long as made, since it's surrounded by water
inside the peptide is `non-polar` interior, outside is polar

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## lecture 2 ##

he start with introducing how different amino acid chemically worked

| group     | name          | notation | resonance/special |
|:---------:|:-------------:|:--------:|:------------------
| R-groups  | 
|           | asparagine    | N        | cannot form NH3+ there
|           | glutamine     | Q        | good at forming hydrogen bonds ; pKA 
|           | serine        | S        |
|           | threonine     | T        |
|           | glycine       | G        | tiny
|acidic     | aspartic acid | D        |
|ionizable  | glutamic acid | E        |
| basic     | lysine        | K        |
|           | arginine      | R        | guanidino
|           | histidine     | H        | imidazole
|           | tyrosine      | Y        | can absorb UV light middle
|           | cysteine      | C        | side chain can react with O2 --> covalent bond with with another cysteine (disulfide bond) 
|hydrophobic| leucine       | L        |
|           | isoleucine    | I        |
|           | valine        | V        |
|           | alanine       | A        |
|           | methionine    | M        |
|           | proline       | P        |
|           | phenylalanine | F        | can absorb UV light worst
|           | trytophan     | W        | have indole ring in it ; can absorb UV light best

[link for different structure of amino acids](https://files.mtstatic.com/site_4334/125069/0?Expires=1737166071&Signature=ZdaFj-e6O9BtglP5dVZjiHASyrfLnjd6MAElXCsnuud-AjbhV07cVGh-BTUqXLy8QYDvDv5NFIFTaqChOoCm~fj8lz8IRuw~T32gzVu5mjFvoT1eCqj6e11kZLqwC38ub8apYYFoJBuWPpVEAmr23woFGXvR1JT77gWn477BcDI_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJ5Y6AV4GI7A555NA)

- indicator of how well they can absorb UV light
  - W > Y > F
  
- importance of cysteine sulfer bond
  - SH group better be maintained 
  - otherwise, it would form the disulfide bond with another cysteine with interaction with oxygen
  - btw disulfide bond make proein more stable
- laboratory solution to this
  - we pour excess `mercaptoethanol: HSCH2 - CH2OH` in there
  - would go the disulfide exchange reaction

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## lecture 3 ##

- in vivo    
  - it's largely composed by different layer of membrane   
  - oxygen are able to cross anywhere those membrane
  - inside mitochondrion, there is Electron transport chain there, ultilze the oxygen
    - complex 4 of ETC requires oxygen --> water ; as electron acceptor
  - oxygen is always oxidizing everything with this mechanis

- cells use `glutathione( y-E-C-G[glycine] ), NADPH and enzyme` to keep SH groups reduced
  - glutathione used to keep SH groups reduced
  - NADPH is the reducing agent ; it would reduced oxidized glutathione 
  - enzyme is speeding up the NADPH ; some energy is ultilze to replenish NADPH

### weak acids/bases (part1) ###

**importance of pH**   

cells use buffers <-- mixation of weak acids and weak bases   
pH of buffers are used to maintain their proper function   
whenever we wanna study cells, we need buffer to maintain buffer for cells    
monoprotic weak acids ; polyprotic weak acids   

- pH
  - pH = - log aH+
  - aH+ is the acitivty of H+ (effective concentration)
  - a = γc <-- M, the amount you weighted out in a certain volume
    - 0 < y <= 1 
    - γ = activity coefficient 
    - he said it's not always that ideal situation to make buffer  

- sodium chloride to γ
  - sodium make -1 in γ (charge)
  - choride make +1 in γ (cahrge)
  - change in γ is not always linear relationship with concentration change
  - since there is charging for shielding 

- weak acid
  - HA -> H+ + γA-
  - HA <------- H+ + γA-
  - weak acid is poor on donating proton
  - activity coefficient is complicated
  - btw we need this to do precise calculation 
  
- for dilute buffer
  - we use the quadratic equation directl to calculation
  
- for non-dilute buffer
  - we should not use the quadratic equation
  - it's not exit in our course  

- at buffer concentrations of 0.1M or higher, y's < 1 
  - pH = - log[H+] 
  
- strong acid
  - something completely dissociated when add to water
  - do not included by `henderson-hasselbalch equation`
  - example of strong acid
    - HCl (chloride ion usually don't screw up biological process)  <-- never should be in a buffer
      - `anything other than quiz than HCl, is weak acid`
      - in our course, we care about most
    - HNO3 (nitric acid) <-- good at 90% organic material
    - H2SO4 (sulfric acid) <-- form a precipitate

- strong base
  - NaOH (sodium hydroxide)
  - KOH (potassium hydroxide) 
  - never belong to the `henderson-hasselbalch equation`
  - `any base that are not OH- must be weak`
  - whenever we mix with some strong and weak, the strong gonna win

```
weak acid environment

example1

HA + H2O -> H3O+ + A- ; HA + H2O <------ H3O+ + A-
  
example2

HA -> H+ + A- ; HA <-------- H+ + A-
y-x          x    x
Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA]
Ka = x^2/(y-x)
x  = [H+]
pH = -log[H+]
```

- *derived of Henderson-Hasselbalch equation*
  - log[Ka] = log[H+]+ { log[A-] / [HA] }
  - -log[H+] = - log Ka + log{[b]/[a]}
  - pH = pKa + log{[b]/[a]}
  - in both top and bottom of the titration curve ; we cannot use this equation
    - since at top and bottom, either acid would be 0 or base = 0 
    - the equation is not gonna make sence out there
  - in the middle of titration curve
    - [b] = [a]
    - pH = pKa
  - a good buffer is when the pH is within +/- 1 ph unit from pKa   


we shall learn how to do this ; like how to calculate this    
also learn when should we use those equations     

```
weak base environment

A- + H2O -> HA + OH ; A- + H2O <------- HA + OH
A- -> HA + OH ; A- <------- HA + OH
y-x   x    x

Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-]
Kb = x^2/(y-x) <-- x is almost 0 compare to y
[Ka][Kb] = 1x10^-14
x  = [OH-]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## lecture 4 ##

### sample question from previous class ###

- given 100ml of 50mM acetate buffer ; pH 5 , using 1.00M CH3COOH, 1.00M NaOH / or 1.00M HCl
  - (0.100l)(0.050M acetate) = 0.0050mol CH3COOH/CH3COO-
  - 0.0050 mol acetate = (x l)(1.00M)CH3COOH
  - x = 0.005 liter = 5ml

- what's %b at pH5?
  - pH   = pKa + $log\frac{b}{a}$
  - 5    = 4.76 + log$\frac{b}{a}$
  - 0.24 = log$\frac{b}{a}$
  - b = 0.635
  
- 0.635 *(0.0050 mol CH3COOH) = 0.003175mol OH- required
  - 0.003175 mol OH- = (x l)(1.00M NaOH)
  - x = 0.003175l = 3.17ml
  
- final conclusion
  - 5ml 1.00M CH3COOH + 3.17ml 1.00M NaOH + water to 100 ml
  - net charge = (0.635)(-1) + (0.365)(0) = -0.635

### more about buffers ###

- characteristics of a good buffer
  - high molarity 
    - for example, reservoir of aicd
    - HA  --> H+ + A- (reservoir of base)
  - Do not interfere with biological process 
    - no activation or inibition of the biological process
    - no interference with chemical assays or columns 

### polyprotic weak acids ###

- phosphate buffers
  - we don't use a lot of phosphate in bio labs
  - it not obey don't interfere rule
    - since in biology, there are lots of phosphate
    - enzyme gonna have them as binding site etc

| chemical | pka
|:--------:|:------------------
| H3PO4    | 2.12  --> to H2PO4
| H2PO4    | 7.21  --> to HPO4  ; 1st intermediate ion
| HPO4     | 12.32 --> to PO4   ; 2nd intermediate ion
| PO4      | none

this is weak acid, since for our purpose of class, any acid except HCl is strong acids   
based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation , whenever pH reach to pKa, it's already half way of deriving first proton    

- takeaway for titration curve
  - he said whenever half way of pH = pKa, solution no longer able to easier go left handside or right handside 
  - btw it's different whenever it's half way to reach the pH = pKa
    - how we determine this pH value
    - pH a this level = $\frac{(pKa+pKa2)}{2}$
    - basically to average those pKa ; get the proper pH value 
  
- more about Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
  - it says for it become a base form, it require at least 2 units for pH larger than pKa
    - we need 2 units larger to it become the base form
  - if we wanna figure out what's the amount to turn the polyprotic weak acids backward to acid form from base from 
    - it requires amount of strong acid
    - through calculation of until solution pH become = $\frac{(pKa+pKa2)}{2}$

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## lecture 5 ##

### different weak bonds ###

- **van der Waals**
  - doesn't matter with pH value; matter with distance
  - exits whenever get touch
  - require two molecules to touch with each other
  - one have higher electronegativity and one don't

- **ionic bond**
  - don't require direct touch between molecules
  - require such salt bridges form wth + and - sign
  - Coulomb's law take charge of it
    - $$F = \frac{q_1 q_2}{\varepsilon r^2}$$
    - $\varepsilon$ is dielectric constant here
    - different checmial stuff have different dielectric constant
  
| different matter | dielectric sontant  
|:----------------:|:-------------------
| vacuum           | 1
| benzene          | 2.3
| water            | 80

- reason why water is high
  - bc water is good at dissolving things with charges on it
  - like aa, phosphate, protein

- sign of q1 or q2 would sometimes depend on the pH value

- **hydrogen bonds**
  - hydrogen bond require some donors there
    - the intermolecular bond
    - like R-OH   ; O high EN ; H low EN
    - like O=C-2R ; acceptor 
    - 90% ionic ; 10% covalent O > N > 5
    - each water can be connected four hydrogen bond; oxygen can be two hydrogen bond donor site, two H can be acceptor site
  - distance matters with strenght of hydrogen bond
  
- **hydrophobic effect**
  - he said what there is flickering clusters
  - hydrogen bond form and disapear dynamically
  - he said another way for form ice for illustrate the hydrophobic effect
    - CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3
    - multiple water conjugated near this organic molecule
    - multiple CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3 gonna form together bc surrounded by water
    - not bc hydrophobic molecule love each other

- how chemically hydrophobic effect is happening 
  - $ΔG = ΔH - TΔS$ 
  - ΔG become negative
  - ΔS become negative with addition of hydrophobes ; btw water make more hydrophobic effect which increase the disorder
    - in total  $TΔS$ become negative
    - $ΔH - TΔS$ the whoele thing become negative
  
hydrophobic effect is the driving force in forming the three dimensional shapes of proteins, DNA, membranes

- look into `dsDNA`
  - ds DNA in shape of double-helix shape  
  - GC have three hydrogen bond
  - TA have two hydrogen bond
  
- the reason why `ssDNa` don't exits
  - bc inside the water system
  - ssDNA with G and ssDNA with C is hard to stay inside the water situtation
  - the hydrophobic effect stablize the shape of dsDNa ; double helix shape
  - 40% H-bonds 60% hydrophobic effect make shape of double helix

- he talks about how the dsDNA become destabilize bc presence of salt; not sure what he mean there
  - shall look back there 

- van der Waals don't matters lot there 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## lecture 6 ##

### oligopeptides ###

- oligo == 'a few'
  - usually lower than 10 resideus
  - oligopeptides, oligosaccharide, oligonucleotide 

- naming rule
  - A-H-P ; alanylhistidylproline

- example A-H-P
  - proline have 3.6 pH at it's C terminus
    - if we add hydrogen to the COO- side
    - we would result decrease of pH 
  - alanyl at N terminus have 7.4 pH 
    - C near the alanyl make stabilization
    - if we add electron to remove the + charge on it
    - we would result increase of pH 
  - histidyl in the middle have 6.0 pH
  -  he said look at different Carbon, nitrogen structure

- with conduction above, we could tell AHP gonna be 6< pH <7.4
  - at pH 8.0; net charge question

- if this is two units away
  - if this is two units lower, we are gonna make it negative charge, donate proton
  - if this is two units higher, we are gonna make it positive carge, receive proton
- elif this is include in two units, we are gonna use to use `Henderson-Hasselbalch equation`
- elif this is close two two units, we are gonna to make charge = 0

### another oligopeptides example ###

- this is famouns in biological cell
  - $\gamma-E-C-L$
  - $\gamma-E$ this is made by enzyme, since ribosome enzyme could not make mRNA out into protein through this
  - cystine 
  - lycine
  - $\gamma-glutamylcystylglycine$
  - $glutathione$
  - what he said previously that important for prevent the disulfur bond 
  
- on the cystine area, there is a SH bond
  - that later used by glutathione for making disulfer bond so that they would not connect with others 

example2

- aspartic acid
  - D 
- phenylalanine
  - F
- methylester
  - it's a methyl group connect to the C terminus, that blocks it, make ester 

- named
  - D-F-methylester
  - aspartylphenylalanylmethylester
  - [aspartame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aspartame?variant=zh-cn) 阿斯巴甜 = nutrasweet
  
- property
  - human made molecules
  - it blocks the C terminus 
  
example3

this example have multiple trans-cis identity on it compare to previous one
- there is three R groups on it
  - R1 R3 are in the trans group
  - R2 are in the cis group
  - make furthest from the molecule as possible
  - form the steric hindrance 
  
- on the formation of peptide bond, there is a possible resonance structure out there
  - almost 40% double bond
  - it makes out a plane
  - on the right peptide bond there is also a plane
  - he said on the test maybe he shall test us to draw the plane

- `swivel carbon`
  - the carbon connect those two plane
  - the carbon as intersection area of the carbon are able to rotate
  - he said better remember those terms
  - $\phi$ and $\psi$ represent the angles that can rotate
  - technically, it can rotate 0 --> 360
  - ![alt text](/image/image.png)

### real world oligopeptide hormones ###

he said remember property of it below, not the structure

- C-Y-F-Q-N-C-P-R-G-NH2
  - this is inside the blood stream (hormone)
  - there is one NH2 on the C terminus that put by enzyme
    - it make it can last longer in blood steam 
  - on two cystine, there is possible to form a disulfur bond
    - it make the overall structure connected fold by such disulfur bond 

- this is called `vasopressin`
  - raises blood pressure by constricting peripheral blood vessels

similar example

- C-Y-I-Q-N-C-P-L-G-NH2 
  - this is called `oxytocin` 宫缩素
  - there is change in slightly amino acid structually
  - btw change in function hugely

they all secreted by the pituitary gland ; ppl earned Nobel prize with isolate and synthesize them  

### proteins ###

-  we wanna study of structures of protein
  - it have different levels of structure

| levels of structure | structure                                              | types of bond
|:-------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------
|1o primary           | linear amino acid                                      | covalent bonds
|2o secondary         | alpha helix ; beta sheet; reverse turn(𝛽-bend)         | hydrogen bonds
|3o tertiary          | 3D shape; water make outside is the non-polar          | hydrophobic effect + 3 other weak bonds + disulfur bond , btw mainly hydrophobic effect (important on quiz he said)
|4o quaternary        | multiple subunits; most end in even number of subunits | hydrophobic effect + 3 other weak bonds(mainly this) + -s-s

- sometimes different subunits communicate with each other

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## lecture 7 ##

- primary structure could transfer into the tertiary structrue because of the protein folding
  - tertiary structure are most thermodynamically stable

- example: `angiogenin` 血管蛋白生成素 17000MW
  - this is used for forming new blood vessels
  - through protein sequencing, we could tell this matches with a rare RNase

- X-ray crystallography
  - this is used to study the structual of the tertiary protein?
  - sending x ray into it, it's gonna decide the real 3D structure

- reason why we need thoses techniques
  - so that we could figure out the real structure of it

### secondary structure ###

- reverse turn/beta-bent
  - given a sequence of aa
  - given beta-bend shape, there is hydrogen bond forms between C-terminus and N-terminus 

- alpha-helix; right-handed
  - he said this is the only thing  ought to remember 
  - 99% percent of alpha-helix are right-handed 
  - R-groups on the outside, pointing downward
  - residue 1H-bonds with resiude 4
  - ($\phi, \psi$) = (-60o, -50o)
  - number of H-bonds = n -4 
  - avergae length = 10 a.a. residues
    - larger than that is no longer alpha-helix 
  - he said it tooks energy to rotate such alpha-helix ; it works once energy get in 
  - reasons make $\alpha$ helix form
    - h-bonds
    - steric hindrance of R-groups; some of them are good
    - non-polar interior of protein 
  
| R-groups that prevent $\alpha$-helix | reason about this
|:------------------------------------:|:------------------
| glycine                              | this is too flexible
| proline                              | wrong geometry ; no H on N for hydrogen bond formation
| -/- ; +/+                            | electrostatic repulsion
| W - W ; F - F                        | too big for too much steric hindrance
| serine                               | prefers hydrogen bond with H2O rather than alpha helix

### continue study on protein ###

- $\beta$-pleated sheet
  - there shall be parallel errow as protein structure

| there is two possible structure | details
|:-------------------------------:|:-------
| parallel $\beta$-pleated sheet  | ($\phi, \psi$) = (-120o, -115o)
| antiparallel                    | ($\phi, \psi$) = (-140o, -140o) ; this is more stable than parallel ; and this could stack together in the antiparallel way

### myoglobin ###

this is the oxygen buffer

- myoglobin have a sort of colours
  - he said there is sort of thing control the chemistry through oxygen for myoglobin

- start with the membrane and ETC in mitrochondria 
  - myoglobin is a single small polypeptide chain
  - whenever oxygen is crossing back and forward through membrane
  - they bind to oxygen weakly, and not changing them
    - oxidized once binds to oxygen
    - maintain the oxygen in the cell
    - example: wheals, it can hold the breath since tons of myoglobin holds the oxygen
  - Mb 1700MW ; the functional protein has a heme

- heme in myoglobin
  - protoporphyrin IX + Fe+2
  - if there is no heme there; it becomes apoprotein
    - apo --> means without
    - apoprotein --> protein without function   

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## lecture 8 ##

start with how myoglobin worked, i missed some information, better rewatch the record

### mechanism of heme ###

- myoglobin have multiple $\alpha$-helix
  - in the deoxy myoglobin 

- Lloyd Ingraham from UCDavis proved something quantum mechanics about this
  - d-obirtals of iron2+ in the deoxy myoglobin
  - the electron would in a `high-spin` format
    - `high-spin` are most are inside the un-pair 
    - once oxygen present, it's gonna change the d-orbital of them
  - the reason the iron is somehow away from those nitrogen are because this reason
  - once the contact with oxygen, it becomes the `low-spin` format

![alt text](/image/image1.png) 

- most oxygen is being absorbed by the mitrochondria, myoglobin only have them a while

lets look another side of the oxygen that contact with the iron2+

![alt text](/image/image2.png)

- `distal histidine`
  - not gonna form a covalent bond
  - it's too away from the ion
  - another side is connect to the oxygen
  - they are adding some protection to the oxygen with forming a slightly proton
  - this somehow stop carbon-monoxide contact contact with this

- we could make another test on the how heme contact with carbon monoxide
  - there is many conjugated double bond
  - they could change to brown from red  
  - he said smoke also related to this
  - distal histidine is making carbon monoxide having 100 lower as binding

- `sandwich`
  - O2 could binds by both heme
  - Fe+2 --> Fe+3
  - it make those heme no longer able to bind oxygen again
  - this is possible oxidation ; once two myoglobin have heme being too close to each other

- the protein are able to twist the ability of electron oritbal
  - x-ray crystallgraphy could prove these
  - on the x-ray crystallgraphy 
    - red are heme
    - blue are chain
    - yellow are histidine
    - CO as magenta binding with a angle

- `cuvette experiment on Mb`
  - initial experiment: cuvette fills with some Mb and buffers  
    - pH = 7.2 are mostly muscle cells for animals, btw different animals have different effection
  - we start putting oxygen into the cuvette
  - we use the light to test how well the light could penetrate verses how much oxygen bound forms
  - experiment result: hypoerbola graph; oxygen bounded verses pressure of oxygen
    - hyperbola are common in biology
    - it something growths exponentially and reach certain limit/threshold 
  - experiment conclusion: the molecules of hemes are mostly acting independently
    - they don't communicate with each other
    - it's 3o structure; subunits don't communicate with each other
  - $P_{50}$ means moment that 50% of oxygen are binding to heme
  - heme are able to be tested through light ; 3dimensional structure is very delicate

- `packing ratio`
  - packing ratio = $\frac{volume-due-to-vanderWaals-radii}{actual-volume}$
  - it's protein have a packing ratio of 1; it means the protein cannot move
    - everywhere inside this protein is fulfilled
  - by x-ray ratio, mostly protein interior is `0.75` 
  - for oil-droplet, it have 0.70 packing ratio
  - non-polar and dynamically moved holes
