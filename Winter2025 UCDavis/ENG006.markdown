### MATLAB comand ###

| Command | Content                                     |
|:-------:|:-------------------------------------------:|
| clc     | clear in python                             |  
| clear   | clear in python, btw delete every varaibles |
| diary   | edit something?  diary off means exit       | 
| exit    | logout MATLAB                               | 
| who     | show all variables in current workspace     | 
| whos    | show all varaibles with more information    |

format command
- format long / short
- format compact / loose

matlab also support print multiple statements in the same line   
just seperate them by the 

- ; (semicolon)
  - this would also not print out that command line
- , (comma)
  - this would print out that command line

### computer compoenent ###

| Component | Function                                                     |
|:---------:|:------------------------------------------------------------:|
| switch    | first form of stuff that make electric represent 0 or 1      |
| processors| some stuff to do the calculation                             | 
| memory    | where different 0 or 1 being stored at                       | 
| program   | yeah, just stuff sequence of instruction to computer         |
| complier  | translate high-level language programs into machine language | 

### numerical ###

for integer

- different integer
  - 8-bit ; up to 255
  - 16-bit ; up to 65535
  - 32-bit ; up to 4294967295
  - 64-bit ; huge number

- signed or unsigned
  - signed 8-bit   : -128 to 127 (half negative and half positive)
  - unsigned 8-bit : 0 to 255

for floats

- **decimal normalized scientific notation**   
  - x*10^x   
  - one digit before decimal number all the time
- **binary normalized scientific notation**
  - x*2^x
  - share the same rule as above

matlab use the `IEEE754 standard` for floating-point representation

for complex number

- either i or j represent single complex number in matlab

### regular constant ###

| notation | meaning |
|:--------:|:---------
| pi       | 3.1415
| NaN      | sort of not-a-number notation; like evaluation for values that don't have a good math number
| Inf      | infinite number
| realmin  | smallest floating-point number
| real,ax  | largest floating-point number


### notation operation ###

someunusual circumstances
- -4 ^ 2 = -16
  - since computer do the x^2 first, and then apply the negative value
  - just have in mind about different priority of notation calculation

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### boolean in matlab ###

it's called logical operator there, 1 is true, 0 is false ; assigning them in matlab is varaiblename = 0 or variablename = 1

| logical operator | meaning |
|:----------------:|:---------
| basic logical operator
| x & y            | this is x and y in python
| x | y            | this is x or y in python
| ~x               | this is not(x) in python
| (none)           | as long as there is one true, it's true, false when both are true
| short circut logical operators
| x && y           | whenever x is true, y is checked ; whenever x is false, y  is not checked
| x || y           | whenever x is true, y is not check ; whenever x is false, y is checked

### priority of logical operation check ###

( ) > ^ > negation > + / + - math operation > relational operator > & > | > && > ||

### other operator in matlab ###

| operator | description |
|:--------:|:------------
| logical operator
| x == y   | x equals y  
| x ~= y   | x does not equal y
| realational operator
| a < b    | 
| a > b    |
| a <= b   |
| a >= b   |

- some exception in matlab
- for example 0 < something < 9
  - matlab would operate lefthand side first
  - and either something is inside or outside this range
  - it would return either true == 1 ; or false == 0
  - so this gonna compare the righthand side to 100% return a True

### matlab script ###

it's something different than python library, it have sort of way u have to store it in some format and call them up later on whenever we wanna use that    
the script can be either stored by .m or .mlx   

### matlab comment ###

it's using the % percentage notation for writing a comment than # in  python 
| comment way | how we do that 
|:-----------:|:---------------
| % something | this is the single line comment
|%{something}%| this is multiple line comment 

### matlab function ###

```
function something we want to operate or input out there

lines we want everything to operate
etc

end
```
that's how everything works out

they also call something `local function` --> this means function whoever locate at the end of a script and appearantly not a sharable function

### output matlab function ###

- disp(variable name)
  - works like print function in python
  - similar 
  - btw for the string u need to make it out before using disp
  - u cannot do what ever like print function in python : modified the string inside the print 

- fprintf(something)
  - it's like print function in python
  - it's gonna able to print something out with modified string in it
  - it also require like C language stuff for a variable name placeholder
  - %f for a decimal variable 

| Operator | Prints      | Description                     |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| `%f`     | fixed-point | Used for floating-point numbers |
| `%d`     | integer     | Prints integers                |
| `%i`     | integer     | Same as `%d`                   |
| `%c`     | character   | Prints a single character      |
| `%s`     | string      | Prints a string                |

| Special Character |Description                                                                 
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `\n`              | Prints a new line.                                                         
| `''`              | Prints a single quotation mark.                                            
| `%%`              | Prints a single percent sign (`%`).                                        
| `\\`              | Prints a single backslash (`\`).                                           
| `\t`              | Prints a tab.

## more about the array of matlab ##

matlab have multiple nice function and different arrays for calculation out there
- logic array
- normal linear algebra array

### array calculation operator ###

| Element-wise operator | Equivalent function | Description                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `+`                   | `plus(a,b)`         | Addition                            |
| `-`                   | `minus(a,b)`        | Subtraction                         |
| `.*`                  | `times(a,b)`        | Element-wise array multiplication   |
| `.^`                  | `power(a,b)`        | Element-wise array exponentiation   |
| `./`                  | `rdivide(a,b)`      | Element-wise array division         |

the logical operator also plays with similar way for array calculation
